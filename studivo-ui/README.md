## 📖 About The Project

**Studivo** flips the traditional service-marketplace model on its head.

On conventional platforms, providers list their services and clients browse passively. Studivo reverses this dynamic: **the student or client defines exactly what they need**, specifying requirements, parameters, and constraints — and the intelligent dispatch core matches those requirements against a pool of verified service providers in real time.

This demand-first architecture eliminates irrelevant listings, reduces negotiation overhead, and puts precision at the center of every transaction. Whether a student needs a custom tutoring plan, a design asset, or a technical deliverable, Studivo surfaces the right provider for the exact job — not a generic approximation.

## ✨ Core Features Implemented

- **🌗 Dynamic Theme Switching** — Seamless Dark / Light mode powered by `next-themes` and Tailwind v4's CSS variable system. A skeleton loader wrapper prevents hydration layout shift (FOUC) on first paint.

- **🌐 Full Bilingual Localization (i18n)** — Complete Arabic and English support following the `next-intl` architectural pattern. Layout direction flips automatically between RTL (Arabic) and LTR (English) at the root layout level, ensuring typographically correct rendering in both languages.

- **🏗️ Feature-Driven Architecture** — The codebase is organized around three clear zones: `app/` owns routing and global providers, `features/` encapsulates isolated domain logic (marketplace, orders), and `shared/` houses reusable components, hooks, and utilities consumed across all features. This separation enforces low coupling and high cohesion as the product scales.
